      Data management and preparation were streamlined with the Jarvis Python package, facilitating loading, stratification, and high-dimensional medical data visualization. TensorFlow served as the deep learning framework for model training.\
      Evaluation employed the Dice score, measuring overlap between predicted and ground truth segmentations. The SENet-based model achieved a remarkable Dice score of 0.84 on the validation set, surpassing the baseline U-Net's 0.77. The Jarvis package enabled comprehensive visualization, aiding identification of segmentation challenges.\
